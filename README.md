# MATHGA-3004_Final_Proj

This repo contains necessary code to produce stream function (isobar and isentropes) of the general circulation, as well as the analyses on zonal wind reversal. The final project is for 2024 Spring MATH-GA 3004 Atmosphere Dynamics instructred by Prof. Ed Gerber at NYU Courant. The project is completed together by Akash Rodhiya & Ken Yan with multiple experiements on 1.5x, 2x, 2.5x, 4x CO2 with MiMA GCM. We also appreciate help from David Connelly fro running MiMA.
